# Confrère

> Totally Free, Totally Canvas

Confrère is a __Clozemaster__ alternative that is free and hosted on [Github Pages](https://guyotjs.github.io/confrere).<br/>
Confrère is built using [MossJS](https://github.com/classicMC-Studios/mossjs) for the game and [SnoJS](https://snojs.github.io/) for text modification.

### Basics

There are no lessons. There are __sentences__. It is a randomly generated large set of _High A1_ to _B2_ sentances that repeat irregulary.<br/>
There are limited languages available right now.
